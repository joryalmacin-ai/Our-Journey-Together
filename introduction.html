    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>“Love has no gender; it simply finds two souls meant to understand each other.”</p>
    <p>Every love story begins differently — some with a spark, some with a glance, and others with a simple “Hi” that changes everything. Ours began quietly, through a screen, between two people who never expected their worlds to intertwine. Strangers to Friends to Lovers: Our Journey of Love is not just a story about falling in love — it is a story about finding connection in unexpected places, healing from brokenness, and discovering the beauty of being loved for who you truly are.</p>
    <p>This is a journey that started with uncertainty and curiosity — two hearts reaching out across distance, time, and fear. It is about the boy who once believed love wasn’t meant for him, and the man who taught him that love doesn’t always need to be loud to be real. Through every chat, every laugh, every misunderstanding, and every reconciliation, we found pieces of ourselves — learning that love is not measured by time or distance, but by how deeply it transforms you.</p>
    <p>In these pages are moments of laughter and tears, courage and vulnerability, distance and closeness. Each chapter is a reflection of growth — from being strangers who knew nothing about each other, to becoming friends who shared secrets, and eventually, lovers who dreamed of forever.</p>
    <p>This story isn’t perfect — it carries pain, doubt, and mistakes — but it is real. It is the kind of love that teaches patience, forgiveness, and faith in something greater than ourselves.</p>
    <p>So here it is — our story. A story of two souls who met by chance and stayed by choice. A story that reminds us all that love, in its truest form, transcends boundaries — because love has no gender, no limit, and no end.</p>
